# Jagadeesh Jetti | Resume Website

This is a **single-page resume website** built entirely with **HTML**.  
It showcases my skills, experience, projects, education, and contact details in a **clean, structured layout**.

The project is built **without CSS**, using semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, and `<footer>`.
